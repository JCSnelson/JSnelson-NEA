\section{Analysis}
        \subsection{Dungeon Crawlers}
        A dungeon crawl is a scenario in role playing games in which the main character navigates a dungeon environment often solving traps or fighting monsters to progress through the level. A video game or board game made up of predominantly dungeon crawls is considered to be a dungeon crawler.\\
        \\
        Most dungeon crawlers have a fixed map that is the same every time which can lead to little replay value as it can be boring to replay the same map over and over.\\
        \subsection{The Problem}
        Dungeon Crawler style games can be boring and repetitive, this means they can have little to none replay value. Additionaly alot of Dungeon crawlers have a steep learning curve that makes it hard for new or casual players to fully enjoy them. These games are also very complex often demanding lots of time for a simple playthrough. In addition, Non-Computational Methods are inconvenient as they can take up alot of space, take a long time to set up and you cannot save your game state to pick it up later easily.\\
        \subsection{Stakeholders}
        \subsubsection{Survey}
        I chose a set of questions in order to survey my stakeholders and help me find success criteria for the project to fulfill their needs.\\
        1. How often would you say you play video games on a scale of 1-10 (1 being every other week 10 being every day)\\
        2. Do you have any specific or requirements for this computer game?\\
        3. How would you use this game?\\
        4. Would you say you have the time to commit to learning a complex or unintuitive game?(yes,probably not,no)\\
        5. How long would you say is your average gaming session?(1-5 hours)\\
        6. Which different ways do you play video games?(multiple choice: controller, wasd, arrows)\\
        7. Have you played any Dungeon Crawler games(e.g. Legend of Zelda, Binding of Isaac, Dead Cells, Hades)?\\
        8. If not would you want to try a Dungeon Crawler Game?\\
        9. Rank the features of classic dungeon crawlers you dislike the most(Lack of Replayability, Long Unskippable Cinematics, High length of time required for a playing session, The Learning Curve, The Difficulty)\\
        10. Rank the features you think are most essential for the game to be enjoyable for you(Procedurally Generated Dungeons, Loot to Collect and utilise, Some Sort of skill tree, Co-Op mode, Puzzles, Hidden Areas)\\
        \newpage
        \subsubsection{Survey Results}
        Time available:\\
        On average my stakeholders session length is around 2 hours for a single game. On average they play videogames almost every day however there is one that plays infrequently. Because of this I will have to try and make it easy to pick up without much you have to remember about previous sessions.\\
        Most of my stakeholders do not have time to commit to learning a complex or unintuitive game and so I will have to make the game easy to pick up but still have complexities for those who want a challenge.\\
        All controlling mechanisms where popular but WASD was the most so I will prioritise that.\\
        50\% of my stakeholders have played dungeon crawlers and so may be experienced with it but 50\% have not so I should aim to make it a good introduction to the dungeon crawler genre with the potential of adding optional difficulty for those more experienced.\\
        \\
        Disliked Features (Ranked most to least disliked):\\
        1. Lack of replayability.\\
        2. High length of time required for a playing session.\\
        3. The Learning Curve.\\
        4. Long Unskippable Cinematics.\\
        5. The Difficulty.\\
        Due to this I will focus on replayability through the use of procedural generation whilst still aiming to exclude the more disliked features.\\
        \\
        Liked Features (Ranked from most to least liked):\\
        1. Some sort of skill tree.\\
        2. Hidden Areas\\
        3. Procedurally Generated Dungeons.\\
        4. Loot to collect and utilise (e.g. weapons).\\
        5. Puzzles.\\
        6. Co-Op Mode.\\
        Because of this I will prioritise getting the more liked features done and exclude some of the less liked features from my success criteria.\\

        \subsection{Research}
        \subsubsection{Existing Solutions}
        \textbf{Edmund McMillen's The Binding of Isaac}\\
        Edmund McMillen created the popular dungeon crawler roguelike The Binding of Isaac and released it on Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The\_Binding\_of\_Isaac/).\\
        This game was relatively unique as it had procedurally generated dungeons \\using a system of rooms that tesalate with each other.\\
        \\
        The procedurally generated dungeons consist of different shaped square based rooms that tesalate and are generated next to each other in a psuedo random fashion whilst obeying a set of rules. The mobs that spawn in each room can vary but there is usually only one or two enemy types per room and as you go up levels the amount of enemies and difficulty the pose increases. This system allows for every playthrough of the game to be different to the next with the same reccuring theme/difficulty which allows for lots of replay oppurtunity. This would be an appropiate way for me to fix the replayabilty issue.\\
        \\
        I like the games simple UI design as it clearly indicates all the necessary parts. The Map also shows the basic stucture of the level without revealing too much.\\
        \\
        However, the game has a couple issues that mean that it does not completely solve our problem. First is the steep learning curve that the game presents which, although to some is a welcome challenge, can put off new or less experienced players especially due to its roguelike nature meaning when you die you start from scratch. The game also has an unintuitive movement and fighting system as there is only really quad directional projectiles and a simple walking design which when combined contributes to the steep learning curve.\\

        \newpage
        \[\]
        \textbf{Motion Twin's Dead Cells}\\
        Motion Twin created the roguelike dungeon crawler and metroidvania Dead Cells which is released on steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead\_Cells/). This game is known for its permadeath system and its procedurally generated dungeons.\\
        \\
        The way Dead Cells uses procedural generation interests me as it allows for there to be some fixed attributes to the level whilst still allowing elements of randomness. The developers talk about how they do this in a video devlog (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\=tyMrRW\-Li\_I), here the dev talks about his system of having a fixed structure for each level almost like a skeleton. This skeleton will include stuff like important rooms along the way and how much distance of rooms has to be between them. It then fills in all the spaces for rooms with one of the many handmade rooms made by the developers. After one room has been chosen for a spot this leaves less choice for the other spots as the rooms need to join and flow into each other properly and so as it chooses more of them the structure of the level is determined similar to the wave function collapse algorithm (https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction\-collapse\-algorithm/).\\
        \\
        This style of generation allows for a unique experience each time whilst keeping a hand crafted and natural feel to the levels that is often lost in other techniques.\\
        \\
        However due to the game being aimed at more hardcore gamers with it being part of the rouguelike genre it can often appear complex and offputting to newer players who dont like the idea of taking multiple runs just to have very little to show for it and not much forward progress in the game. Although the game is a side on game I think that I will use the idea of its procedural generation as inspiration in my product.\\
        \\
        \newpage

        \textbf{Nintendo's Legend Of Zelda Breath of the Wild}\\
        Nintendo created the open-world dungeon crawler which is released on the Nintendo Wii U and the Nintendo Switch (https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-70010000000023). This game is known for its open world approach to dungeon crawlers as well as its easy to pick up nature for first time players.\\
        \\
        The game starts with a tutorial that teaches players the mechanics of the game (combat, exploration, and resource gathering). This tutorial helps players into the world without overwhelming them, offering opportunities to learn at their own pace which helps reduce the steep learning curve of other games in the genre. The open-world nature of the game also adds to its replayability, allowing the player to take many different routes to complete the game. However, while the game’s size and allows for alot of replayabilty, the volume of content and time required to explore everything can reduce its effectiveness as a game that can be picked up easily for shorter sessions. Its 3D world and complex systems are features that would be too tricky to implement within the scope of an A-level computer science project. It also does not fully fit the dungeon-crawler genre, particularly as it is less dungeon-focused.\\ 
        \\
        I want to take inspiration from the open-world nature of the game to increase replayability aswell as its approach to tutorials in order to make the learning curve steeper. Ontop of this another feature I would like to take inspiration from is the intuitiveness of the combat system which is easy to learn but hard to master in particular its feature of being able to lock onto enemies.\\
        \\
        Some features I will not be including are the 3D nature and the overall content heaviness aswell as the focus less on dungeon crawling as I believe these would be unnecesary features which would drive up the complexity of the solution both to make and run.\\
